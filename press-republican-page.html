    <p>I first studied the design and usability of the original website. I made notes of changes I wanted to incorporate for a more clean, visually pleasing interface.
    </p>
    <img src="Images/pr/pressrepublicansketch.jpg" class="prsketch">
    <p>Next I sketched up wireframes for a desktop, mobile, and tablet version of my new redesign.
    </p>

    <p>I then narrowed down the layout of my wireframes, developed them on Sketch, and started adding content from the website to get a visual of the potential outcome. I played with different colors from the new palette I chose to see what worked best.

    <p>I imported my finished prototypes into Flinto to start the interaction design process. This is an example of my organization of my layers in Flinto.

    <p>Conducted 15 Heuristic Evaluations to compare the usability and design of the original website to the version that I redesigned.
    </p>
    <img src="Images/pr/prradar.png" class="prradar">
    <p>Organized all of the results into one Excel sheet and created a radar chart to get an overview of the responses. I did my final tweaks of components of my page based on the results and until I was satisfied with the redesigns.
