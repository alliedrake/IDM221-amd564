    <p>
        My name is Allison Drake and I'm 19 years old  born and raised in Easton Pennsylvania.
        I am a second year Interactive Digital Media major here in Philadelphia.
        So far, it has been exciting experience for me and I've been introduced to so many new things.
        Growing up, I knew I was drawn to technology being a career I'd explore and I always had an interest in art,
         so the design aspect of Interactive Digital Media is what really sold it for me here.

<!--Second Paragraph--> 
<section>
    <div class="paragraph_two">
    <p>
        When I'm not occupied with school, I am either playing sports or working. I played soccer, lacrosse, and dove in high school and
        I am currently apart of the Drexel women's lacrosse team. During my free time I am usually listening
        to music, finding new things to watch, and exploring the city. As of now, I see myself being a UX/UI designer and I'm interested 
        in learning more about visual identity/branding. I plan on staying in Philadelphia or taking on a big city to pursue my work.
