    <p>
        My name is Allison Drake and I'm 19 years old  born and raised in Easton Pennsylvania.
        I am currently starting my second year as an Interactive Digital Media student here in Philadelphia.
        Overall, it has been exciting experience for me and I've been introduced to so many new things.
        I had taken web design and html my freshman year of high school and that class is what made me drawn
        to computer science and that eventually led me to IDM. Growing up, I knew I was drawn to technology as
        a career and I always had an interest in art so the design aspect of Interactive Digital Media is what
        really sold it for me here.

    <p>
        When I'm not occupied with school, I am either playing sports or working. I played soccer, lacrosse,
        and dove in high school and I am currently apart of the Drexel women's lacrosse team. I enjoy collaboration
        and hearing other's ideas because different perspectives help to take on tasks in a productive way. As of now,
        I see myself being a UX/UI designer and I'm interested in learning more about visual identity/branding. I plan
        on staying in Philadelphia or taking on a big city to pursue my work.
