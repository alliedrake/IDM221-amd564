        My name is Allison Drake and I'm 19 years old  born and raised in Easton Pennsylvania.<br>
        I am currently starting my second year as an Interactive Digital Media student here in Philadelphia.<br>
        Overall, it has been exciting experience for me and I've been introduced to so many new things.<br>
        I had taken web design and html my freshman year of high school and that class is what made me drawn<br>
        to computer science and that eventually led me to IDM. Growing up, I knew I was drawn to technology as<br>
        a career and I always had an interest in art so the design aspect of Interactive Digital Media is what<br>
        really sold it for me here.

    <p>
        When I'm not occupied with school, I am either playing sports or working. I played soccer, lacrosse,<br>
        and dove in high school and I am currently apart of the Drexel women's lacrosse team. I enjoy collaboration<br>
        and hearing other's ideas because different perspectives help to take on tasks in a productive way. As of now,<br>
        I see myself being a UX/UI designer and I'm interested in learning more about visual identity/branding. I plan<br>
        on staying in Philadelphia or taking on a big city to pursue my work.
